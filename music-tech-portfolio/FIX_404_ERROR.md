# ðŸ”§ Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## What Happened?

The 404 error means Vercel deployed your project but couldn't find the pages. This is a common Next.js deployment issue.

## Solution

I've added the necessary configuration files. Now follow these steps:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/portfolio/music-tech-portfolio
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - add config files"
git push
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `music-tech-portfolio` project
3. Click on it
4. Click the **"Redeploy"** button (or "Deploy" if you see it)
5. Wait for deployment to complete
6. Click the URL to view your portfolio

## What I Fixed

âœ… Added `vercel.json` - tells Vercel how to build your Next.js project
âœ… Verified `next.config.js` - configuration is correct
âœ… Verified `netlify.toml` - Netlify config is ready

### Option 1: Clear Vercel Cache

2. Settings â†’ Git
3. Click "Redeploy" with "Use existing Build Cache" unchecked

### Option 2: Rebuild from Scratch
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to "Deployments"
4. Click the three dots on latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Option 3: Check Build Logs

## Verify Locally First

Before redeploying, make sure it works locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

## Still Having Issues?

The files you need are:
- âœ… `vercel.json` (I created this)
- âœ… `netlify.toml` (already exists)
- âœ… `next.config.js` (already exists)
- âœ… `package.json` (already exists)

All are configured correctly now!
